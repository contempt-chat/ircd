address is replaced by 255.255.255.255 (SPOOF_IP).

changelog:

 v1.02

 2020-01-27 -- mh

  * ircd/s_serv.c:m_sidtrace(): minor cleanup

  * ircd/s_user.c:register_user() fixed bug that caused ip to show up
    in realname due to not cleaning up after me :( -- mh (reported by
    patrick)

 v1.01

 2020-01-17 -- mh

  * included patch versionlen v1.00 to replace hardcoded value

  * POOF_PASSWDLEN extracted to its own patch passwdlen v1.00 and
    included it

 2020-01-12 -- mh

  * SPOOF_WELCOME and SPOOF_WELCOME_ALL config.h defines added. both
    disabled by default. some clients will try to get their local
    address by parsing the hostname in RPL_WELCOME. this will remove
    the user@host part from RPL_WELCOME reply on connect for spoofed
    clients (SPOOF_WELCOME), or for all clients (SPOOF_WELCOME_ALL),
    and only show the nickname. the latter can be defined without
    SPOOF defined and will override the former if that is defined.
    the former can only be defined with SPOOF defined. added to STATS
    d as S1.

  * SPOOF_IP config.h define added. the IP address shown instead of
    the real one (for example in /STATS L) for spoofed clients. this
    defaults to "255.255.255.255".

 2020-01-11 -- mh

  * included patch whoisextra v1.00

  * RPL_WHOISCLOAKED will use RPL_WHOISEXTRA if it is defined or fall
    back to 320

  * SPOOF_WHOISCLOAKED message changed to be more in line with the
    320 used for SSL connections on eu.irc6.net

  * PASSOPTS extracted to its own patch passopts v1.01 and included
    it

  * initial version based on passopts v1 (po+spoof) which is in turn
    based on the ircd spoof patch by patrick at ircnet.com:
    https://github.com/ircnet-com/misc/tree/master/ircd-spoof-patch
